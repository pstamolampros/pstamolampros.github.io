Using a dataset of more than 380,000 airline passenger reviews obtained from TripAdvisor, we show that on average passengers express higher satisfaction (as proxied by their overall rating) for airline service encounters with domestic carriers, exhibiting a form of domestic bias. Using Hofstede’s framework, we examine how cultural dimensions influence the strength of this bias and find support for the moderating impact (positive and negative) of passengers’ cultural dimensions on their provided ratings toward domestic airlines. The study has theoretical and practical implications for international marketing researchers and airline operational planners.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Evaluating domestic bias on airline passengers’ ratings: The moderating effect of cultural value orientation","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"test test test\nFinding:\n","date":1585699200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1585699200,"objectID":"dc72e4c92290269d1dec10690986c1be","permalink":"/publication/tourism-management-2/","publishdate":"2020-06-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tourism-management-2/","section":"publication","summary":"National culture exerts substantial influence on consumers' expectations, satisfaction, and evaluations. Despite that, within a service-based context, two cultures are met, that of the customer and that of the service provider, the existing literature systematically explores the effect of customer culture in isolation neglecting the impact of the provider's culture or their joint effect. We fill this gap by considering the concomitant effect of customer and provider cultural factors on passenger evaluations of airline carriers using a large dataset of reviews that covers the majority of countries. Employing a response surface methodology, our study provides significant advantages over methods based on cultural distance scores in revealing more complex non-linear relationships. This multi-dimensional approach provides new insights for assessing the impact of national culture on customers' service perceptions and evaluations, thus bringing significant implications for researchers and service providers.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"The joint effect of consumer and service providers’ culture on online service evaluations: A response surface analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"ee86c372b14dcfebb040e52b361852cf","permalink":"/publication/annal-of-tourism/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/annal-of-tourism/","section":"publication","summary":"The research note discusses the informational value of online employee reviews in tourism and hospitality research and practice.Online reviews can complement existing approaches offering access in a pool of opinion highly representative of the industry. Theresults of our analysis reveal that the unstructured form of reviews through topic analysis can efficiently capture important topics foremployees and is in agreement with previous literature. As such it opens new avenues for researchers and practitioners since theintangible and heterogeneous nature of tourism and hospitality services can be measured with more direct data sources available tothe decision makers, than cross-sectional questionnaires.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Harnessing the wisdom of employees from online reviews","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1575158400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1575158400,"objectID":"67234653b71f7f08dba2a0de253f9426","permalink":"/publication/tourism-management-1/","publishdate":"2019-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tourism-management-1/","section":"publication","summary":"We explore a special case of electronic word of mouth that of employees' online reviews to study the determinants of job satisfaction and employee turnover. We perform our analysis using a novel dataset of 297,933 employee online reviews from 11,975 US tourism and hospitality firms, taking advantage of both the review score and text. Leadership and cultural values are found to be better predictors of high employee satisfaction, while career progression is critical for employee turnover. One unit increase in the rating for career progression reduces the likelihood of an employee to leave a company by 14.87%. Additionally, we quantify the effect of job satisfaction on firm profitability, where one unit increase leads to an increase between 1.2 and 1.4 in ROA. We do not find evidence supporting the reverse relationship, that growth on firm profitability increases job satisfaction. The feedback to management in employee reviews provides specific managerial implications.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Job satisfaction and employee turnover determinants in high contact services: Insights from Employees’Online reviews","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1559347200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1559347200,"objectID":"534b0692bc4e05274a132fc203c2423d","permalink":"/publication/air-transport/","publishdate":"2019-06-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/air-transport/","section":"publication","summary":"This study examines the impact of interest rates, fuel prices, and market concentration on airline service performance. Rather than focusing on an airline-level analysis, we employ aggregated data from the US Department of Transportation (DOT) and the Airline Consumer Report (ACR) to explore four airline service performance metrics, namely: on-time performance, cancelled flights, mishandled baggage, and passenger's complaints. We gauge the long run effect of the variables of interest using an Autoregressive Distributed Lag bound approach. The findings reveal long-term linkages between airline service levels and the variation in interest rates and market concentration providing new evidence on the trade-off relation between financial pressures and service quality and has practical implications for both regulators and airline managers. Our results are robust to business cycle effects including the great recession.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Airline service quality and economic factors: An ARDL approach on US airlines","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1548979200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1548979200,"objectID":"6b04ad893c2850420e88e4418ff8242f","permalink":"/publication/expert-systems/","publishdate":"2019-02-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/expert-systems/","section":"publication","summary":"test test.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Measuring service quality from unstructured data: A topic modeling application on airline passengers’ online reviews","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"test test test\nFinding:\n","date":1538352000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1538352000,"objectID":"6badace3826020e9dd21d76bfc047c60","permalink":"/publication/contemporary-hospitality/","publishdate":"2018-10-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/contemporary-hospitality/","section":"publication","summary":" While the literature has established the effect of online reviews on customer purchase intentions, the influence of psychological factors on online ratings is overlooked. This paper examines these factors under the perspective of Construal Level Theory (CLT). Using review data from TripAdvisor and Booking.com, we study three dimensions of psychological distances (Temporal, Spatial, and Social) and their direct and interaction effects on review valence, using regression analysis. We examine the effect of these distances on the information content of online reviews employing a novel bag-of-words model to assess its concreteness.Temporal and spatial distance have positive direct effects on review valence.Social distance, on the other hand, has a negative direct effect. However, its interaction with the other two distances has a positive effect, suggesting that consumers tend to “zoom-out” to less concrete things in their ratings. The findings provide implications for the interpretation of review ratings by the service providers and their information content. Our study extends the CLT and eWOM literature by jointly exploring the effect of all three psychological distances that are applicable in post-purchase evaluations. Methodologically, it provides a novel application of the bag-of-words model in evaluating the concreteness of online reviews.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Exploring the behavioral drivers of review valence: The direct and indirect effects of multiple psychological distances","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"test test test\nFinding:\n","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"55a372c6f8246c72aa1447e632df27b6","permalink":"/publication/economic-letters/","publishdate":"2018-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/economic-letters/","section":"publication","summary":"test test.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Employees’ online reviews and equity prices","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"9dcf891a5476a9c288b463ecd4bea7d1","permalink":"/publication/journal-of-travel-research/","publishdate":"2018-04-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-of-travel-research/","section":"publication","summary":"test test.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Flying to Quality: Cultural Influences on Online Reviews","type":"publication"}]
